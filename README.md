Creating a realistic Earth with Three.js involves more than just applying a texture. This project aims to simulate various natural phenomena to achieve a lifelike representation of the Earth.

## Features

- Cities on the dark side of the Earth are illuminated to show human activity.
- Cloud layer.
- Sun's reflection primarily visible on the oceans, not continents.
- The transition zone between day and night (twilight) has a reddish hue.
- The atmosphere surrounding the Earth creates a volumetric glow
